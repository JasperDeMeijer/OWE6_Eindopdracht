OWE6_Eindopdracht Java
Jasper de Meijer, 560144, BI2D

For running the program run the main class: OWE6_Eindopdracht.java

Known bugs:
*when creating the VennDiagramm the used Jpanel expands a bit.
*When the VennDiagramm is created and a dropdown menu is opened the part where the dropdown
overlaps with the venndiagramm the VennDiagramm disappears(will be returned when the user presses
analyze again).
